    <h1>Coronavirus in the United States</h1>
    <h2>COVID-19 is now the No. 3 cause of death in the United States, surpassing accidents, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and
      many more.</h2>

    <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>

    <p>From <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>:</p>
    <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses found mostly in animals. In humans, they can cause diseases ranging
      from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East
      Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The disease caused by the new coronavirus has been named COVID-19.
    </p>

    <p>While many of the characteristics of COVID-19 are still unknown, mild to severe illness has been reported for
      confirmed cases.
    </p>

    <h3>How does the virus spread?</h3>
    <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory
      droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or
      noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in
      close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
    </p>

    <h3>Why it is important to wear a mask</h3>
    <p>To reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings when around people
      outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
    </p>

    <p>Masks may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others. Wearing a mask will help
      protect people around you, including those at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and workers who
      frequently come into close contact with other people (e.g., in stores and restaurants). Masks are most likely to
      reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings. The spread of COVID-19 can
      be reduced when masks are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing, frequent
      handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.
    </p>

    <img src="./img/2.jpg" alt="covid-19 symptoms">

    <p>The masks recommended here are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that
      should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders. Masks are not personal protective equipment
      (PPE). They are not appropriate substitutes for PPE such as respirators (like N95 respirators) or medical
      facemasks (like surgical masks) in workplaces where respirators or facemasks are recommended or required to
      protect the wearer.
